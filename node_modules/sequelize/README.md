# Sequelize #

The Sequelize library provides easy access to a MySQL database by mapping database entries to objects and vice versa. To put it in a nutshell... it's an ORM (Object-Relational-Mapper). The library is written entirely in JavaScript and can be used in the Node.JS environment.

## Features ##

- Schema definition
- Schema synchronization/dropping
- Easy definition of class/instance methods
- Instance saving/updating/dropping
- Asynchronous library
- Associations
- Importing definitions from single files
