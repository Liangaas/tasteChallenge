- where -> A hash with conditions (e.g. {name: 'foo'}) 
           OR an ID as integer
           OR a string with conditions (e.g. 'name="foo"').
           If you use a string, you have to escape it on your own.
- order -> e.g. 'id DESC'
- group
- limit -> The maximum count you want to get.
- offset -> An offset value to start from. Only useable with limit!


OK... you can define classes and associations. You can save them. You would probably like to get them from 
the database again ;-) Easy:

<pre><%- koala(".js", partial("code/find-objects/basics.ejs")) %></pre>

Of course you can pass a some options to the finder methods, to get more relevant data:

<pre><%- koala(".js", partial("code/find-objects/options.ejs")) %></pre>
